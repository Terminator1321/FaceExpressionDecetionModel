#NOTE : I haven't properly trained the model yet its accuracy is around 44% so trained it first 

# FaceExpressionDecetionModel
This repository contains a simple AI model for facial emotion detection, capable of recognizing seven emotions: anger, sadness, happiness, neutral, disgust, fear, and surprise. It includes the trained model, Face_ExpressionAI_train.ipynb for training, ModelTest.py for testing, and datasets for training and testing the model.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to facial emotion detection. Using a CNN model, it analyzes facial expressions to classify emotions into 7 categories.


## Features
- Detects 7 emotions: anger, sadness, happiness, neutral, disgust, fear, and surprise.
- Simple and lightweight AI model.
- Ready-to-use with pre-trained model files.
- Easily customizable with your own datasets.
